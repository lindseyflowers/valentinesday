<h1> Love Cards </h1>
<h2> Sweet nothings that don't mess around </h2>

<p> It's easy to get wrapped up in the sap, poetry, and sweetness on Valentine's Day--grocery store aisles are brimming with cards full of metaphors, cursive writing, and elegantly drawn hearts. Here at Don't Sugarcoat It, we believe that you shouldn't say in three stanzas what you could say in a sentence. Our line of Love Cards features everyday declarations that say exactly what you feel, without the added fluff and sugar. </p>
